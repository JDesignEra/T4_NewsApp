## Note
* **Potential Bug / Issue:** If there is an issue with the Loading Alert not being dismissed after a long duration you can change the value from `2` to `1` or `0` in `OfficialNewsViewController.swift` line **76** temporarily, and let [Joel](https://github.com/JDesignEra) know, so I can try to fix the issue if there is any.
